# Virtual Joystick X

Joystick Control for Cocos2d-x (C++)
===================================================

This is a simple Joystick for Cocos2d-x written in C++!

This was part of a Computer Science class I took in college.
I have included a Resource folder with necessary images,
a CMakeLists.txt file, and the Classes folder.


Enjoy!
